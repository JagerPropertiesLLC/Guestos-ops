## How to use this file

This is the single source of truth for every Claude session working on this platform. **Read it before doing anything.** Both this Claude project and any Claude Code session should orient from this file first.

**Update rhythm:**
- The chat that ships work also updates the relevant section ("State" or "In flight") and commits the change as part of the same commit.
- Strategic decisions go in "Decisions log" so we don't re-litigate them in future sessions.
- "Open questions / Next up" is the queue for whatever's coming.
- When you find drift between this doc and the real codebase, fix the doc in the same chat. (May 4 lesson — six weeks of LTR / Marina / CAM / Insurance work shipped without anyone updating this file, and the next session almost built Phase 6 against a fictional schema.)

**Role separation across sessions:**
- **Strategic chat (Claude project, this file's home)** — planning, screenshot review, direction, updating this doc. Doesn't write production code.
- **Claude Code sessions** — execution. Builds what's in "In flight." Updates "State" when shipping.
- **One-off side chats** — try not to. If used, they don't touch this doc.

## What we're building

A property and construction management platform with three sides:
- **STR (Short-term rentals)** — 5 properties / 16 units in Pueblo, CO. Live, in `TEST_MODE`.
- **LTR (Long-term tenants)** — schema fully built, UI mostly stubbed.
- **Construction project management** — fully built (Phase 5 shipped May 3). Two live projects:
  - **West Center Tech** — warehouse development at 201 N Laredo St, Aurora, CO 80011
  - **La Maison Moderne** — Judson's personal home renovation at 917 N Kalamath St, Denver, CO

Eventually replaces Hostaway as its own channel manager (direct sync to Airbnb / VRBO / Booking.com). Web today, mobile later. Multi-org capable, currently single-org.

## Modules in production

| Module | What's there | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **STR** | GuestOS agent, cleaning schedule, approvals queue, tasks, dream-team roster | Live in TEST_MODE |
| **LTR** | Full tenant/lease/portal/comms schema; `/long-term/leases` page (degraded — calls 404 APIs and shows empty) | Schema + 1 page |
| **Marina / commercial** | Slips, addons, annual launch passes, daily launch log | Schema only, no UI |
| **CAM reconciliation** | Annual rollup with snapshot fields, monthly QBO totals as source of truth | Schema only, no UI |
| **Maintenance** | Generic kanban over `maintenance_requests`, filterable by module | Shipped |
| **Tasks + Scheduler** | Unified `tasks` table (STR + construction), 14-day staff scheduler grid, AI rewrite | Shipped |
| **Insurance & Compliance** | Property × coverage traffic-light grid, vendor COI table, renewal-request stub | Shipped |
| **Property Tax** | Records list with paid/due/overdue pills | Shipped |
| **Auth / RBAC** | Capabilities catalog, per-grant overrides, super-admin hardcode for now | Shipped scaffold, RLS off |
| **Construction** | Projects, phases, budget, expenses, subs (G702/G703), loans, draws, COs, inspections, permits, SWPPP | Phase 5 shipped |

The audit also found ~24 sidebar nav entries that 404 (mostly `/short-term/*` and `/long-term/*` placeholders) and a couple of API routes referenced from UI that don't exist (`/api/leases`, `/api/tenants`). Tracked under "Open questions."

## Repo & deployment map

| Layer | Repo | Hosted | URL |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Server / agent brain** | `JagerPropertiesLLC/CasitasEnPueblo-Agent` | Railway (project: `aware-embrace`, service: `CasitasEnPueblo-Agent`) | `casitasenpueblo-agent-production.up.railway.app` |
| **Ops frontend** | `JagerPropertiesLLC/Guestos-ops` | Vercel | `guestos-ops.vercel.app` |
| **Database + Storage** | n/a (Supabase project: JagerPropertiesLLC's Project) | Supabase (us-east-2, Ohio) | `wlopfprejttqpdyqntrr.supabase.co` |

Local paths (Windows machine):
- `C:\Users\jjager\Desktop\CasitasEnPueblo-Agent` — server (also has its own `CLAUDE.md` with architecture detail; read it before changing the agent)
- `C:\Users\jjager\Desktop\Guestos-ops` — frontend

Auto-deploys: Railway and Vercel both auto-deploy from `main` on push. Vercel env var changes require manual redeploy from Deployments tab. **Important:** ignore the Railway project `faithful-strength`. The live one is `aware-embrace`. There's a second Supabase project `ACC-CRM-DEV` (us-west-1) — unrelated, belongs to Asphalt Coatings; do not touch.

Universal rules: check-in 4 PM, checkout 11 AM, all Schlage Encode locks, $30 early check-in fee before 2 PM, free 3 PM only as pushback negotiation.

### What's working
- **GuestOS** (Hostaway + Quo SMS → Claude → reply) running on Railway with 14 training rules baked into the prompt
- **Cleaning schedule** built nightly at 7 PM Mountain Time, Sam gets SMS at 7 PM and 7:30 AM day-of
- **Approvals** persist to Supabase (replaced in-memory Map; survive restarts)
- **Schedule UI** at `/schedule` with timezone bug fixed
- **524 guests / 2,170 messages** backfilled from Hostaway + Quo (April 27)
- **AI drafts** logged for training (`ai_drafts`, 262 rows)
- **Maintenance task system** at `/tasks`, `/tasks/new`, `/tasks/[id]` (photo upload, AI rewrite via Railway `/tasks/rewrite`, completion-photo gate)
- **Dream team** roster (`dream_team`, 6 rows): Darcee, Jaime, JWV, Judson Jager, Sam, Wendy

### Still TODO
- Flip `TEST_MODE` to false (currently `true` on Railway)
- Resume training session — 5 of 184 AI drafts reviewed
- Schedule UI "completed today" view (currently shows latest push only)
- Acero Hostaway integration + Zelle setup for Washington/Orman
- `listings` backfill with Hostaway IDs (`LISTING_ID_MAP` in `server.js`)
- Quo calls — 69 of ~180 captured, 111 recoverable from business-number cleanup
- Main guest line not yet pulled from OpenPhone

## LTR side — State

Schema is fully built (tenants, leases, lease_tenants, lease_rent_changes, security_deposits, tenant_invoices, tenant_payments, tenant_documents, tenant_screening, tenant_portal_users, tenant_favors, rent_reminder_log, plus a separate `comms_threads`/`comms_messages` stack for tenant messaging). Zero rows live — no real LTR tenants yet.

`/long-term` lists LTR properties (just Kalamath today, derived from entity slug). `/long-term/leases` renders, but its `/api/leases` and `/api/tenants` endpoints don't exist — page handles 404 gracefully and shows empty.

Sidebar promises rent-roll, aged receivables, maintenance, vendors, property-tax, insurance, utilities, financials views — none built yet. Tenant portal route doesn't exist either, though `tenant_portal_users` does.

Property tax and insurance UIs are shipped but live at the cross-module roots (`/property-tax`, `/insurance`), not under `/long-term/*`.

---

## Marina / commercial side — State

Schema built for slip/RV/container rentals plus annual launch passes and the bulk daily launch log. CAM reconciliation tables (`cam_reconciliations`, `cam_reconciliation_line_items`, `property_cam_monthly_totals`) sit alongside; `properties.is_cam_property` and `properties.total_rentable_sf` are already there. `leases.marina_unit_id` exists for slip leases (mutually exclusive with `unit_id`).

No UI, no API, no nav entry. `marina_unit_types` is the only table with seeded rows (12 — slug catalog).

---

## Maintenance task system — State (shipped)

Two flavors coexist and need eventual reconciliation:
- **`/tasks`** — STR-original flow over the unified `tasks` table. Photo upload to `task-photos` Storage bucket, Railway `/tasks/rewrite` for Claude-vision text cleanup ("flix gutter pipe" → polished version, side-by-side approval). Completion photo required. Sam's view rolls into her schedule page.
- **`/maintenance`** — kanban (New / Acknowledged / Assigned / In progress / Completed) over `maintenance_requests`. Filterable by module (`str` / `ltr` / `construction`).

`/scheduler` is a 14-day staff grid built on `task_assignments` + `staff_availability`. `/api/scheduler/auto-fill` handles auto-assignment of recurring `target_tasks`.

---

## Construction module — State (Phase 5 just shipped)

Lives at `/construction` and `/construction/[id]`.

**Projects in production:**
- **West Center Tech** — warehouse development, 201 N Laredo St, Aurora, CO 80011. **The project that started the construction module** — needing SWPPP for the warehouse kicked off the entire build (SWPPP → inspections → subcontracts → draws → lien waivers → tasks → change orders).
- **Kalamath / La Maison Moderne** — Judson's personal home reno, 917 N Kalamath St, Denver, CO — project ID `a3137184-7589-4f42-bdb8-159da24319e6`. Same module.

### Phases shipped

| Phase | What shipped |
|---|---|
| **1** | Projects, lookups (entities/markets), project header with `counts` shape |
| **2** | Budget categories, phases, expenses |
| **3** | Subcontracts (AIA G702/G703 line items), loans, draws |
| **4** | SWPPP — projects, inspections, BMPs, signature image, PDF export, weather-driven SMS workflow |
| **5** *(May 3)* | Tasks, change orders, construction inspections, SwpppTab inline section, DELETE retrofit (sub w/ deps → 409 with combined `draws + change_orders` count), `open_inspections` added to counts shape |

**Project page sections (9 total):** Overview · Subcontractors · Inspections · Permits · SWPPP · Change Orders · Draws & Lien Waivers · Documents · Photos. Documents and Photos are stubs — Phase 6 fills them in.

**`counts` shape on project header:** `open_tasks`, `pending_change_orders`, `subcontracts`, `open_inspections`.

### Construction tables (correct names — yesterday's CONTEXT had these wrong)

Tables are **not prefixed `construction_`**. Real names: `projects`, `project_phases`, `project_budget_categories`, `project_expenses`, `project_loans`, `project_draws`, `project_reports`, `project_contacts`, `subcontracts`, `subcontract_line_items`, `change_orders`, `inspections`, `permits`, `licenses`. **Tasks live in the unified `tasks` table** with `project_id`/`phase_id`/`subcontract_id` columns — STR maintenance and construction tasks share one table.

The Rolodex pieces are already wired in: `subcontracts.company_id` + `.contact_id`, `inspections.inspector_company_id` + `.inspector_contact_id`, `coi_records.company_id` + `.document_id`, `project_expenses.vendor_company_id` + `.vendor_contact_id`. **Phase 6 should build on top of this, not replace it.**

Views: `project_financials` (`total_spent = expenses_paid + draws_paid`, replaces deprecated column), `project_loan_status` (live drawn-to-date / available balance per loan).

### Deferred construction items (in `project_pending_schema_cleanups.md`)

CHECK constraints + `updated_at` columns on `subcontracts`, `subcontract_line_items`, `project_draws`, `change_orders`, `inspections`, `tasks`. Drop the denormalized `subcontracts.amount_paid` / `.amount_retained` once we're sure nothing reads them. `co_number` race-safety. Real per-caller `tasks.org_id` resolution before second tenant. Bundle in one cleanup migration.

### Phase 6 (queued — corrected scope)

Files + required-docs checklists + Rolodex polish + field log + photo report PDF. **Must adapt to the existing schema:**
- **`documents` already exists** as the canonical doc store, with FKs from `coi_records`, `licenses`, `permits`, `policies`, `tenant_*`, `house_manuals`, `project_loans`, `project_expenses.invoice_document_id`, `property_taxes`, etc. Extend it with section/subsection + a "fulfills required slot" link, don't make a parallel `files` table.
- **`contacts` is "people at companies"** with FK to `companies`, not a flat name+tags model. Vendor required-docs (W-9/COI/license) belong on `companies` (which already has `w9_on_file`, `coi_on_file`, `coi_expires`, `ein`).
- **New tables only for genuinely novel things:** required-doc templates + per-property/per-company slots, field-log photos, photo-report metadata.

Pending the corrected build prompt before kickoff.

## SWPPP sub-module — State (complete)

Per-project config in `swppp_projects` (1 active — West Center Tech). Hourly weather poll → `swppp_weather_readings` (155 rows). Rolling 24h rain ≥ project threshold creates a `swppp_weather_events` row triggering the 24-hour inspection clock. Mon 7 AM weekly report compiler PDFs the prior 7 days into Storage. SMS workflow on Railway (`backend/swppp-sms.js`) fires the weekly inspection SMS at a deterministic-but-random minute Mon 7–9 AM MT; replies POST to `/api/swppp/inspections/auto-create` which builds the inspection record + signed PDF.

Public-facing routes: `/swppp/inspect/[swpppId]` (smart form), `/swppp/qr/[swpppId]` (QR for the inspector), `/swppp/public/[token]` (auditor view, AppShell chrome stripped).

**Cron duplication caveat:** the hourly weather check + Monday weekly report exist in both Vercel `/api/cron/*` and Railway `swppp-cron.js`. Pick one canonical home before changing either.

---

## Database

Supabase Postgres 17 (us-east-2). RLS **disabled** platform-wide — must be enabled with proper policies before non-admin users get access.

88 tables, 10 views. The full inventory was audited May 4 and lives in chat history; the audit found the platform is significantly broader than the May-3 doc described (Marina, CAM, Tenant Portal, full Insurance/Compliance, full LTR scaffolding all in the schema). Module-by-module summaries are in the State sections above.

**Storage buckets in use:** `task-photos` (maintenance task issue + completion photos), plus paths embedded in `swppp_photos.storage_path` and `swppp_reports.storage_path`. Phase 6 will add `platform-files` (or extend `documents` storage) and `field-log`.

**Verified column names (don't guess these):** `properties.short_name`, `properties.full_address`, `units.unit_label`. `dream_team.display_name` UNIQUE.

**Multi-tenant scaffolding is in place but only one org row exists.** `DEFAULT_ORG_ID = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'` is stamped on every Railway-side write. Phase-5 construction APIs use a singleton lookup of the one organization row; refactor to a real per-caller resolver before standing up tenant #2.

---

## Auth / RBAC

Capability-based model. `app_users` (7 staff/owners) auth-link to Supabase Auth. `entities` (8 LLCs) own `entity_stakeholders` (8 stake records). `user_access_grants` (7 active) issue per-(user, market, entity, property, module) role grants; `user_capabilities` overrides them per grant. `capabilities` (78) is the catalog.

Resolution lives in `lib/permissions.js`: `currentUserId()` is currently hardcoded to look up `judson@duracoproperties.com` (super_admin). Once Supabase Auth is wired into the frontend, swap with the real session lookup. `canUserDo(...)` calls Postgres `user_has_capability(...)`.

UI: `/settings`, `/settings/users/[id]`, `/settings/properties/[id]`. API under `/api/admin/*`.

---

## Environment variables

### Railway (CasitasEnPueblo-Agent service)
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `HOSTAWAY_ACCOUNT_ID=81734`, `HOSTAWAY_API_KEY`, `QUO_API_KEY`, `QUO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `QUO_BUSINESS_PHONE_ID`, `SAM_PHONE_NUMBER`, `OWNER_PHONE_NUMBER`, `STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK`, `OPS_APP_URL=https://guestos-ops.vercel.app`, `SCHEDULE_API_SECRET=guestos_schedule_2026`, `SUPABASE_URL=https://wlopfprejttqpdyqntrr.supabase.co`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (new `sb_secret_...`), `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` (SWPPP), `RAILWAY_SHARED_SECRET` (must match Vercel), **`TEST_MODE=true`**.

### Vercel (guestos-ops)
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (new `sb_publishable_...`), `SCHEDULE_API_SECRET=guestos_schedule_2026`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (for `/tasks/rewrite` proxy and any future Claude calls), `RAILWAY_SHARED_SECRET` (must match Railway), `CRON_SECRET` (Vercel cron auth).

**Important:** legacy Supabase API keys are **disabled** (migrated April 26). Do NOT re-enable — the old `service_role` was exposed in chat.

---

## Endpoints

### Server (Railway)
`GET /debug` · `GET /env-check` · `GET /test-schedule` · `GET /test-morning` · `GET /schedule-status` · `GET /health` · `GET /approvals` · `POST /approvals/:id/approve` · `POST /approvals/:id/dismiss` · `POST /webhook/hostaway` · `POST /webhook/quo` · `POST /tasks/rewrite`. In-process crons handle the cleaning-schedule push (7 PM eve, 7:30 AM morn MT) and SWPPP (hourly weather, Mon 7 AM weekly report, Mon-window inspection SMS).

### Frontend (Vercel)

## Decisions log

- **Apr 26** — Migrated Supabase to new key system. Old keys disabled. Anthropic key rotated.
- **Apr 26** — Approvals moved to DB (was in-memory Map). `replyFn` closures cached, reconstructed from `source + external_conv_id` after restart.
- **Apr 27** — 14 training rules baked into system prompt. Database state preserved before pause.
- **Apr 28** — Build construction as separate **module** in same platform (not separate system, not crammed into STR tables). Reason: shared core (org, payments, contacts), but data model and UI genuinely different.
- **Apr 28** — Maintenance task photos → Supabase Storage `task-photos` bucket. AI rewrite shows side-by-side, user approves. Completion photo required.
- **Apr 28** — Dream team uses `display_name` UNIQUE constraint. Roster locked: Darcee, Jaime, JWV, Judson Jager, Sam, Wendy.
- **May 3** — Phase 5 design decisions: `org_id` singleton lookup deferred (refactor later when 2nd org), SwpppTab inline (not detail page), `open_inspections` added to header counts shape.
- **May 4** — CONTEXT.md rewritten after audit found ~6 weeks of drift (full LTR / Marina / CAM / Tenant Portal / Insurance / Property Tax / Maintenance / Scheduler infrastructure built without documenting). Construction tables confirmed unprefixed (`projects` not `construction_projects`; tasks unified). Phase 6 paused pending corrected build prompt that uses existing `documents` + `contacts`/`companies` tables instead of inventing parallels.

---

## In flight

Nothing actively building. Phase 6 (Files + Required-docs + Field log + Photo reports) is paused pending the corrected build prompt — see Open questions.

---

## Open questions / Next up

### Immediate
- **Phase 6 corrected build prompt** — extend `documents`, use `contacts`/`companies` Rolodex, vendor required-docs at the company level. Greenlight the corrected prompt before kicking off.
- Trim or build the ~24 dead sidebar nav links — they 404 silently right now.
- Decide canonical SWPPP cron home (Vercel `/api/cron/*` vs Railway `swppp-cron.js`) and remove the duplicate.
- Build `/api/leases` + `/api/tenants` (the minimal endpoints `/long-term/leases` is already calling).

### STR side (medium priority)
- Resume training session (5 of 184 AI drafts reviewed)
- Schedule UI "completed today" view
- Acero Hostaway integration + Zelle setup for Washington/Orman
- Listings table backfill

### Eventually
- Flip `TEST_MODE` → false (after training session lands)
- Build channel manager (direct sync Airbnb/VRBO/Booking.com)
- LTR module fleshed out — first real tenant, rent-roll, aged receivables, tenant portal, comms wiring
- Marina / CAM UI build-out
- Mobile app for Sam and field staff
- Real Supabase Auth wired in, replace `HARDCODED_SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` in `lib/permissions.js`
- Enable RLS with capability-based policies

---

## Working style (Judson)

- Full file rewrites > inline edits
- One step at a time (multi-step instructions are overwhelming)
- Hands-off execution — Claude does the work, Judson copy/pastes/runs
- Plain unformatted text in chat (formatted code blocks are hard to copy on his setup)
- Terminal + git for deployments
- Verify existing schema before writing SQL that depends on it (don't guess column names)
- When CONTEXT.md is wrong, fix it in the same chat — don't ship work on top of stale context

### Guest communication tone
- Casual & warm: "Hey [name]", "No sweat!", "My pleasure!"
- Emojis sparingly (😊 🙏)
- Sign off: "Judson" or "Your Pueblo Hosting Team"
- Spanish with Spanish-speaking guests
- **Never says:** "Sound good?", "I apologize for any inconvenience", "per our policy"
- Free 3 PM check-in only as pushback negotiation
- Sam contacted only when her input is needed
